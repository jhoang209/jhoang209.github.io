It's been awhile since my last update because I've been busy with other things this past month. I did, however, start my first Raspberry Pi project. The goal was to light up an LED using the GPIO pins of the Pi. I setup my Pi using the Noobs software from their web, and then remotely accessing the Pi from my laptop using Putty and a bit of setting changes. Then with a little bit of python coding, I was able to complete that task fairly easily using a solderless breadboard, small led, 330 ohm resistor, ribbon cable, and t-cobbler for the pi. I learned that you should use 330 ohms so that we limit and ensure a safe amount of current is flowing through for any LED. For LEDs, a small change in voltage causes a large change in current, which will destroy the LED. With a resistor, the change in voltage and current is proportional, and so the current is limited to a safe amount. After completing that, I added some more functionality to the little circuit, but I will talk about that later, as well as upload photos.
