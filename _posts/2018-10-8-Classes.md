Hey! School has started for me recently so I probably won't be working with my RPi for awhile. However, I am currently taking two design courses which I will hope to talk about more when we do more exciting things. At the moment, My partner and I are working on desigining and creating a time fountain. This is basically manipulating frequencies so that we can make it seem as if the water droplets from the fountain is changing speeds. For my other design, we are going to work on making an autonomous car. We are only going through the fundamentals at the moment though. I am also going to working with an TI's RSLK, Robotic Systems Learning Kit, which I look forward too since it seems very interesting. Before that though, I am going to have to focus on all the homework and labs I have been bombarded with. Hopefully I can stick to blogging about once a month or so.
